          <h1>Instructions</h1>
          <p>
            Pick through your lentils for any foreign debris, rinse them 2 or 3
            times, drain, and set aside. Fair warning, this will probably turn
            your lentils into a solid block that you’ll have to break up later
            In a large pot over medium-high heat, sauté the olive oil and the
            onion with a pinch of salt for about 3 minutes, then add the carrots
            and cook for another 3 minutes. Add the tomato paste and stir it
            around for around 1 minute. Now add the cumin, paprika, mint, thyme,
            black pepper, and red pepper as quickly as you can and stir for 10
            seconds to bloom the spices. Congratulate yourself on how amazing
            your house now smells. Immediately add the lentils, water, broth,
            and salt. Bring the soup to a (gentle) boil. After it has come to a
            boil, reduce heat to medium-low, cover the pot halfway, and cook for
            15-20 minutes or until the lentils have fallen apart and the carrots
            are completely cooked. After the soup has cooked and the lentils are
            tender, blend the soup either in a blender or simply use a hand
            blender to reach the consistency you desire. Taste for seasoning and
            add more salt if necessary. Serve with crushed-up crackers, torn up
            bread, or something else to add some extra thickness. You could also
            use a traditional thickener (like cornstarch or flour), but I prefer
            to add crackers for some texture and saltiness. Makes great
            leftovers, stays good in the fridge for about a week.
